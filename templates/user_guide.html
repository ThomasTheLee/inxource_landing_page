  <!-- 1. Getting Started -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
    <h2>1. Getting Started with Inxource</h2>
    <p>
      Every great business starts with clarity. When you sign up for Inxource, you're not just creating an account — you're building the command center for your business.
      It takes only a few minutes to register your name, email, and password, and from that moment on, you'll have your own dashboard — where everything that matters about your business lives.

  <!-- 2. Payment Options -->
  <section style="margin-bottom: 80px;">
    <h2>2. Choosing How You Get Paid</h2>
    <p>
      When you subscribe, Inxource gives you flexibility — because every business works differently. You can choose to use the
      <strong>Inxource Wallet</strong>, where your money stays secure with Tech Pay Zambia. Think of it as your digital business bank account — easy to manage, withdraw, and track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or, you can transact outside the wallet. Maybe you prefer direct mobile money or cash payments. That's fine too.
      Every order still shows up on your dashboard — you simply confirm it as "Paid."
      Either way, you'll still enjoy the same data insights, analytics, and growth features.
      The choice is yours — because flexibility is power.
