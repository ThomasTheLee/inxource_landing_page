    <h1>The Unsung Heroes of Our Economy</h1>
    <p>
      To every small business owner and manager — thank you. You are the heartbeat of our economy. You employ, innovate, and keep communities alive. SMEs like yours make up over 70% of our economy, and yet, you often work the hardest with the least recognition. This page is for you — a message of gratitude, empowerment, and possibility.

  <h2>As a Boss, You Deserve to Know Everything About Your Business</h2>
  <p>
    Running a business is a journey filled with courage and endless decisions. Every day you make choices — when to restock, what to promote, how to serve your customers better. But what if those decisions weren’t guesses? What if you could see clearly how your business is performing, who your most loyal customers are, and where your biggest opportunities lie?
  </p>
  <p>
    Understanding your data means more than just numbers. It’s the difference between hoping and knowing. It’s being able to compare this month’s sales to last year’s, spotting patterns before they become problems, and realizing which days or locations drive your success. It’s knowing who keeps coming back and why — and finding out where you’re losing customers before it’s too late.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data gives you the power to make smarter, faster decisions — not because you studied statistics, but because you understand your own story. That’s what every business owner deserves.

  <h2>The Tools Big Companies Take for Granted</h2>
  <p>
    Walk into a large supermarket or corporate office and you’ll find something invisible but powerful — data. These companies know exactly what sells, who buys, and when to launch something new. They have access to expensive POS systems, ERP software, and teams of analysts who translate every sale into strategy.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what about you — the mother who just opened a bakery, the young man selling shoes after class, or the woman running a small salon in town? You don’t have a team of engineers or a million-dollar system. Yet, your dream, your effort, and your drive are just as powerful. You deserve the same clarity and control — without the cost or complexity.

  <h2>How Inxource Levels the Playing Field</h2>
  <p>
    At <strong>Inxource</strong>, we built a platform designed to give you the same insight and intelligence big businesses enjoy — but in a way that’s simple, human, and affordable. Imagine being able to see, from anywhere, how your business is doing right now. You open your dashboard and instantly see: today’s total sales, who’s been buying, and which area is driving the most growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    You don’t need to be in the shop to know what’s happening. Whether you’re at home, on the road, or managing multiple locations, you stay connected. You’ll know when sales rise, when they slow, and even when your most loyal customers visit. No complex reports. No spreadsheets. Just clear information that helps you act quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    For those who sell online, we go a step further. Inxource gives you your own online store — one you can share with customers who prefer to order remotely. They can upload pictures, write delivery details, and even describe exactly what they want — like asking for a Barbie doll on top of their daughter’s cake. And all of it appears neatly in your dashboard, ready to fulfill.

  <h2>What If You’re Tired and Just Want to Rest?</h2>
  <p>
    We understand that sometimes you’re tired, busy, or simply want quick answers without scrolling through charts. That’s why we built <strong>Lenny</strong> — your AI assistant who talks to you like a real teammate. Just ask her, “How much did we sell today?” or “Why are my sales lower this week?” and she’ll tell you — clearly and instantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lenny isn’t just a chatbot. She’s your business companion. She helps you interpret your numbers, understand your customers, and even gives advice on what to improve next. With Lenny by your side, understanding your business becomes as easy as having a conversation.

  <h2>What Other Entrepreneurs Are Saying</h2>
  <p>
    “Before Inxource, I didn’t really understand how my salon was doing week to week. I used to rely on guesses and notes in my phone. Now I can see everything in one place — and Lenny even gives me tips on how to grow. It’s like having my own data team.” — <strong>Thandi, Salon Owner (Kitwe)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    “I used to think data was only for big companies. But now, every morning, I check Inxource on my phone. It shows me how many orders I’ve received, what’s trending, and even what customers love most. It’s changed how I run my business.” — <strong>Maria, Bakery Owner (Ndola)</strong>
